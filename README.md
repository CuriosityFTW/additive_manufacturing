***Project objective:*** *Microstructure prediction of Ni-based superalloys produced by Directed Energy Deposition (DED)*

**My contributions:**
* Worked on the microstructure analysis and grain growth modeling of Nickel-based superalloy parts produced by the Directed
Energy Deposition (DED) process using SPPARKS, a Kinetic Monte Carlo Simulator
* Developed Python scripts to determine the real-time temperature variation at the locations of thermocouples in the DED of Ti-6Al4V parts via modifications of Rosenthal’s solution
* Incorporated virtual heat source pairs to characterize the cooling effect in past layers, and mirrored heat sources to characterize
adiabatic boundary conditions and substrate thickness
* Developed Python scripts to determine temperature gradient, solidification rate, G/R ratio, and heat flow direction at the
solidification front of the heat source’s melt pool for different scanning patterns
* Incorporated 4 heat source models in the scripts: Point heat source, 2D Gaussian heat source, 3D semi-spherical heat source, and
Goldak’s double-ellipsoidal heat source
* The developed Python scripts were finally linked to SPPARKS simulations for the generation of predicted microstructures of the DED parts
